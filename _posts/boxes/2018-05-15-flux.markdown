Hello this a **writeup** for a box from [HackTheBox][HackTheBox-link] which is focused mainly on ***WAF*** Bypassing.

First things first, we launch a nmap to scan for open ports,
```shell
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.10.69 -T4 -v
```

![flux_nmap]({{ "/assets/img/flux_nmap.png" | absolute_url }})

Cool port 80 is open, checking the source code we find the following

![flux_source0]({{ "/assets/img/flux_source0.png" | absolute_url }})

browsing to this `/sync` file, returns a forbidden page ummm... that's weird, I tried to curl it

```shell
curl "10.10.10.69/sync" -v
```

![flux_curl0]({{ "/assets/img/flux_curl0.png" | absolute_url }})

Well... we have a **WAF** here :D, after poking around I found it blocks requests that contain `;` and other special characters.

Let's run wfuzz to bruteforce some existing parameters

```shell
wfuzz -w /usr/share/wordlist/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt  --hh 19  "http://10.10.10.69/sync?FUZZ=random'stuff"
```

![flux_wfuzz0]({{ "/assets/img/flux_wfuzz0.png" | absolute_url }})

great `opt` is the right parameter, after playing with it, I found out that it blocks words like `ls` `cat` etc ...
this can be easily bypassed by adding quotes like the following `l's'` which equals `ls` this happens because all adjacent string literals are concatenated in Bash, by doing that I bypassed the WAF but still no command execution...

After an extensive manual fuzzing, i found that if I put `opt=' i'd''` I get command execution !!!


![flux_rce]({{ "/assets/img/flux_rce.png" | absolute_url }})

cool, let's run `sudo -l`


![flux_sudol]({{ "/assets/img/flux_sudol.png" | absolute_url }})

We can execute `/home/themiddle/.monit` as root, let's check that file

![flux_file_monit]({{ "/assets/img/flux_file_monit.png" | absolute_url }})

Easy!, we just have to run this script and give it 2 arguments, the first one must be `cmd` and the second one our command base64 encoded and we are root !

![flux_root]({{ "/assets/img/flux_root.png" | absolute_url }})
